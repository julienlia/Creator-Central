<p style="font-size:20px; font-family:Verdana;">Before you can do anything, you will need to have Adobe Photoshop installed.
  You can do this by using this link:

<p style="font-size:20px; font-family:Verdana;">Let's begin with the basics of Photoshop.
  The Adobe app 'Photoshop' allows you to edit any photo you upload using very extensive and professional tools.
  When it comes to photo-editing, there is nothing better than using Adobe Photoshop!
</p>

<p style="font-size:20px; font-family:Verdana;">As you can see from the image below, there are plenty of tool available to use when editing an image.
  Under that, you can find a list of what each tool category does:

<img src="Photoshop Tools.jpeg" alt="Photoshop Tools"
 style="width:500px;height:500px;">

 <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:Verdana;">Selection Tools: These tools are based around selecting a certain area on an image for use with another tool.
 <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:Verdana;">Crop and Slice Tools: These tools are based around removing areas of an image entirely.
 <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:Verdana;">Measuring Tools: These tools are based around finding the specifics of an image, such as the colour and size of an area on the photo.
 <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:Verdana;">Retouching Tools: These tools are based around morphing and manipulating the image without adding something external.
 <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:Verdana;">Painting Tools: These tools are based around, as you would expect, creating custom images using in-app tools such as the pencil tool or the brush tool.
 <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:Verdana;">Drawing and Type Tools: These tools are similar to the painting tools, however they are more based on text, as can be seen through the pen and type tools.
 <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:Verdana;">Navigation Tools: These tools are based around changing your view of an image, through zooming in or moving it to a selected side.
